# Odin Recipes

This is the first project I will be doing for The Odin Project course. In this project I will be building a basic recipe website. The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.

I do not really have a favorite food, but I do have a favorite anime, which is One Piece, so I thought I would include some of the recipes from Sanj's recipe book: One Piece Pirate Recipes.
