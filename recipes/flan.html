        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dessert was introduced in volume 46, chapter 446 and is surprisingly sweet considering it was made by zombies. At this time the crew was making their way through Gecko Moria's huge, halloween-like pirate ship. Here they met a lot of interesting characters, one of them being Dr. Hogback, a mad scientist who was creating an army of zombies for Gecko Moria. This was quite a scary adventure for the crew, but at least some of them got to eat some flan.</p>
