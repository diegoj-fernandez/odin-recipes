        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This dish was first introduced in volume 53, chapter 522 of the manga during Luffy's last night on the island of Amazon Lilly. Amazon Lilly is an especially dangerous island for two reasons. It is located inside of the calm belt, which does not experience any wind (definitely not the best place to sail a pirate ship), and its surroundings are nesting grounds for enormous aquatic neptunians, hence the name of this dish.</p>
